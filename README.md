# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains multiple machine learning projects where different algorithms like SVM, Decision Trees, KNN, and Random Forest are applied on datasets such as Iris and MNIST.

## Projects

- **SVM (Support Vector Machines) on Iris Dataset**: 
  Applied SVM algorithm with different kernel functions (linear, rbf, poly, sigmoid) for classification. Evaluated the model performance using accuracy score and confusion matrix.

- **Decision Tree Classifier on Iris Dataset**:
  Built and visualized a Decision Tree for classifying the Iris dataset. Evaluated model accuracy and performance.

- **KNN on MNIST Dataset**:
  Implemented KNN algorithm to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Calculated the model accuracy for performance evaluation.

- **Random Forest Regression for House Price Prediction**:
  Developed a Random Forest model to predict house prices based on features like area, number of rooms, and location. Evaluated model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
